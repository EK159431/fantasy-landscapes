    This pirate ship sails around the vast ocean, through a never ending night.
    No one knows who the crew is, nor where they sail. Yet they do know that no one
    wants to go near the ship. They had said the captain of the ship had jumped overboard leaving
    his crew. The crew had found to where he was lost in waters. When he came back aboard, they welcomed
    him with open arms were in the end they had closed their trust and within the same night took
    him and beheaded him. Ever since then there has been a continues full moon that never ceases to exist.</p>

    Once what was a beautiful castle, now turned into a flourishing
    forest of broken pillars and small wild animals. First vines and ivy had encaptured it throughout the hold,
    then grew flowers in which awaken with the first rays of sunlight after their closed slumber of moonlight.
    not many go to this sacred place, afraid of not just what might lurk within the peacefulness, but also so that
    they do not destroy the harmony that it has created for itself.</p>

    This land used to be full of life, until one day there was an eclipse.
    This eclipse has brought nothing but pain and sorrow, bring the cold harsh weather of snowy blizzards and dead plants. What was once a cozy mountain village,
    turned into nothing more then ice. Most people have died, now for those who are still alive are forever cursed with a reoccurring eclipse.
    They won't know when this will end but do know that with every night, the weather does nothing but get colder and colder.</p>

    A war was once here. Many died, most taken home and buried. One was forgotten.
    He had found his way into this secluded part of the forest, breathing his last breaths he died by this tree, all that's
    left is his old red scarf that he hung from it's branches as a signal of his resting place to not be disturbed. He fought hard and with a battle won
    he knew that he could rest easy, whispering his last goodbyes to his family back home. He laid his head down and closed his eyes. The rest is history.</p>

    The forest of shadows where only the most daring go, but the most foolish
    die. No one has been able to get through this forest to see what is on the other side, those who have been in there, never come out.
    There is said to be strange shadow monsters that will eat one's soul and put them within eternal torment. The only one who has seen such
    creature is the elder fo the village that lives outside of the forest. They had almost died just by stepping by it, not daring
    to enter but enough just to see how dreaded and hateful the place is.</p>
